## 🛠 Technology Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| React | 18.x | UI framework |
| TypeScript | 5.x | Type safety |
| Vite | 7.x | Build tool |

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Dynamic Form Rendering
Forms are rendered dynamically based on JSON schema from the backend:
```typescript
{
  questions: [
    { id: "q1", label: "Question", type: "text" },
    { id: "q2", label: "Count", type: "number" },
    { id: "q3", label: "Select", type: "dropdown", options: [...] }
  ]
}
```

### Webhook Configuration
Two event types supported:
- `0` = Form Submitted
- `1` = Form Approved

Webhooks fire automatically on submission and approval events.

### Mock Authentication
Currently uses Customer ID 1 (Jefferson County) as mock authentication.
In production, integrate with real authentication system.
